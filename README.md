# ValorantAPI

A work-in-progress API for accessing Valorant data in Swift. Currently being developed in tandem with my app [Recon Bolt](https://github.com/juliand665/Recon-Bolt).

## Documentation

There's some in-code documentation, but I hope you'll find that it's mostly self-explanatory once you get going. Simply create a `ValorantClient` by signing in (a static method on it) then use the methods the instance offers to execute requests.
